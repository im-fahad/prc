# PRC on Android

The phone half of PRC. It pairs with a Mac, shows that Mac's screen, and drives its pointer and
keyboard.

The Macs can host or control. The phone only controls, which is why this app is much smaller than
`apps/prc`.

## What it does today

- Makes one identity per phone, an ECDSA P-256 key generated inside the Android Keystore and never
  exportable, and shows its fingerprint at the top of the screen.
- Pairs with a Mac from the code that Mac displays, proving possession of the code with an HMAC and
  checking that the Mac's key hashes to the id printed in the code. Both people compare fingerprints.
- Signs every signaling envelope and applies the same receiver rules as the Macs, so a replayed,
  stale, misaddressed or unsigned message is refused.
- Runs the session handshake, then offers a WebRTC connection the Mac answers, and shows the
  screen it sends.
- Sends input on the three data channels the protocol defines: pointer moves on the unordered one,
  clicks, scroll and typing on the reliable one.
- Magnifies the picture on the phone, since a desktop shrunk onto a phone has text a few pixels
  tall.

## Using it

Tap a paired Mac to open its screen. Then:

| Gesture | What the Mac sees |
| --- | --- |
| Tap | the pointer moves there and clicks |
| Drag one finger | the pointer follows the finger |
| Hold still | a right click |
| Pinch | magnifies the picture on the phone, up to four times |
| Drag two fingers | scroll, or pan the picture while it is magnified |
| Keys | the phone's keyboard, typing into the Mac |
| End | leaves the session |

The pointer is absolute: it goes where the finger lands rather than moving by a relative amount.
Pinching magnifies the picture on the phone and asks the Mac for nothing, so it costs no bandwidth
and works while the link is poor. The pointer stays exact while magnified.

## Build and install

Needs a JDK 17 and the Android SDK. The Gradle wrapper is checked in.

    cd apps/android
    ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

`local.properties` is not checked in; either write `sdk.dir=...` into it or set `ANDROID_HOME`.

## Tests

    ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest

There is a second check that runs from the repository root, `npm run android-frames`. It validates
every data channel frame the app can send against the protocol's own JSON Schemas, using the same
validator the Mac uses. Run `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` first, since that is what writes the
frames out.

The Gradle tests run the vectors in `packages/protocol/vectors`, the same ones the TypeScript and Swift
implementations run: device ids and fingerprints, the exact bytes an envelope signs, the pairing
proof, and sixteen receiver cases covering replay, tampering, clock skew and unknown senders. If
the phone disagrees with a vector it disagrees with both Macs, so these are the tests that matter.

## Driving it from a computer

A debug build accepts two intent extras, the way the Mac app can be driven by its control CLI. A
release build ignores them, so no other app can start a pairing.

    # pair, passing the Mac's code as base64url
    CODE=$(prc-controller-cli app offer-pairing --data-dir "$HOME/Library/Application Support/PRC" | head -1)
    adb shell am start -n com.prc.controller/.ui.MainActivity \
      --es pairing_code_b64 "$(printf '%s' "$CODE" | base64 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')"

    # then approve on the Mac
    prc-controller-cli app approve --data-dir "$HOME/Library/Application Support/PRC"

    # connect, naming the Mac by the start of its fingerprint
    adb shell am start -n com.prc.controller/.ui.MainActivity --es connect 8C65

Everything the app prints on screen also goes to logcat under the tag `PRC`.
