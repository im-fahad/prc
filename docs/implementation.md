# PRC as built

What exists today, how it works, and the things that were learned the hard way. The design this
follows is [spec.md](spec.md); where the two differ, this file describes reality and the spec has
been amended to match.

Written 2026-09-09 and brought up to date 2026-09-10, at commit `8cb60cf` on branch `v0.2-hybrid`.
Tag `v0.1.0` on `main` is the last state where the agent and the controller were separate apps.
[../README.md](../README.md) is the guided tour: the technology, the flow, and how to use it. This
file is the record of decisions and traps.

---

## 1. What it does

One Mac shows its screen to another and accepts its mouse and keyboard. It works on a LAN with no
server at all, and across the Internet over a Tailscale tailnet. Every message that sets up a
session is signed by a per-device key, so neither the network nor a relay can impersonate either
side or read anything.

As of v0.2 a single app fills both roles: a Mac can control, be controlled, or both. The Android
app is a controller only, and it is finished enough to use daily: it pairs by scanning the Mac's
code, shows the screen in H.264, and drives the pointer and keyboard with the gestures the
established remote desktop apps settled on.

```

The icon is drawn, not painted: `scripts/make-app-icon.swift` renders it as vectors at each size
and packs the result with `iconutil`. Run it only when the artwork changes, since the build uses
the committed `assets/AppIcon.icns`.

`apps/mac-agent` and `apps/mac-controller` still carry their own SwiftUI app targets from v0.1.
Those are superseded by `apps/prc` and are due for removal; their libraries and CLIs stay.

## 3. How a session happens

1. **Discovery.** The host advertises `_fahad-remote._tcp` over Bonjour with its device id in the
   TXT record. Away from the LAN the controller uses a stored address instead, and tries every
   address it knows in parallel, taking the first that answers.
2. **Signalling.** The host serves a WebSocket on port 47500. There is no server in the middle;
   the design keeps room for one but Tailscale has made it unnecessary.
3. **Authentication.** Request, challenge, auth, accept. Both sides sign, both check the other's
   nonce. Only then is SDP exchanged, and because the SDP travels inside a signed envelope the
   DTLS fingerprint is signed too.
4. **Media.** The controller offers, the host answers. Video is H.264 from ScreenCaptureKit
   through VideoToolbox. Three data channels carry input and control.
5. **Input.** The controller maps pointer positions to normalised coordinates, the host turns them
   back into Quartz events.

## 4. The parts, and why they are shaped that way

### packages/protocol

JSON Schema is the source of truth, not the code. `npm run codegen` emits TypeScript types *and*
the Swift key code table, so the table cannot drift between platforms. `npm run vectors` writes
signing inputs, envelopes, pairing proofs and TURN credentials that both the TypeScript and Swift
test suites consume, which is what proves a message signed on one platform verifies on the other.

### Envelopes

Every signalling message is a signed envelope. The signature covers a fixed context label and eight
fields joined by newline, with the payload as base64 of the exact JSON bytes the sender produced,
so no canonical JSON is needed across three languages. Receiver rules run in a fixed order and any
failure is final: size, version, recipient, known sender, signature, clock skew, replay, schema.

`seq` restarts at 1 per session. In the empty session namespace it restarts per *attempt*: one
pairing exchange, or one session request and its answer. Both sides reset after the reply, so a
retry starts again at 1.

### PRCPeers

One record per peer holding the key once and two independent permissions: **may control us** and
**we may control it**. Key lookups are gated on the relevant permission, so revoking a direction
makes verification fail closed rather than relying on a check at the call site. A peer allowed
neither is dropped.

Pairing sets both directions. That costs nothing in trust, because a single pairing already
exchanges both public keys and both people compare fingerprints. What stops a Mac being controlled
is its own hosting switch, which is off until turned on.

### The app

`apps/prc` runs as a menu bar item with a window on demand. Hosting is off by default and turning
it on is what constructs the hosting half, so a Mac used only as a controller never touches screen
capture and is never asked for those permissions.

### The phone

One identity per phone, an ECDSA P-256 key generated in the Android Keystore and never exportable,
which is the same promise the Macs get from the Secure Enclave. The protocol layer is a direct
translation of the TypeScript reference and is checked against the same vectors, so the three
implementations agree by construction rather than by inspection. Pairing and the session handshake
work, and so do video and input: the phone offers, the Mac answers, and the picture arrives on the
same socket the handshake used. Pairing is done by scanning the QR the Mac draws, decoded on the
phone from the camera's brightness plane with no Play Services and nothing uploaded. Touches are
absolute rather than trackpad-relative, because on a phone the whole desktop is visible at once, so
putting the pointer where the finger lands is both quicker and easier to aim. Pinching magnifies the
picture on the phone alone and asks the Mac for nothing, which costs no bandwidth and keeps working
on a poor link; the arithmetic that keeps the pointer exact under magnification lives in
`PointerMapping` and is tested without a phone. The controls live on a sidebar drawn over the black
bar beside the picture, so they cost no part of the Mac's screen: touch or trackpad, the keyboard,
session info, and end. The icons have no labels and name themselves when held, which is where
Android puts the name of a control that has no caption. The info panel reports what the connection
is actually doing, read from `getStats` rather than guessed, and that panel is what found the two
codec bugs below. A debug build can be driven by intent extras, the way the Mac app can be driven by
its control CLI, which is how the flow is tested without typing on the phone.

### Testing without hardware

- `--synthetic-screen` streams a generated pattern, so video paths can be exercised with no Screen
  Recording permission and no display.
- `PRCLocalControl` gives each app a loopback port and a token in its data folder, so a script can
  press the same buttons a person would. This is how pairing, connecting and measuring were driven
  from a second Mac over SSH.
- `tools/e2e` spawns the real agent binary and drives it from Node using werift, a WebRTC
  implementation independent of libwebrtc, which is a genuine interoperability check.

## 6. Things that cost time, so they should not cost it twice

**Never change the app's activation policy at runtime.** Switching between accessory and regular
leaves an existing Metal-backed video view drawing nothing: frames still decode and the renderer
still reports their size, so everything looks healthy while the picture is black. The policy is set
once at launch.

**Never close the window to hide it.** Closing destroys the scene's views and the replacement
window gets a dead video view, with the same symptom. Order it out and back in instead.

**Ad-hoc signatures change every build.** macOS ties Screen Recording and Accessibility to the
signature, so after reinstalling, the switch in System Settings can read as on while the new build
has nothing. The install script clears the stale entry with `tccutil reset`. A free local signing
identity would end this, but the owner chose no certificates.

**Declare the real network path.** The controller used to claim `lan` always, so the host seeded a
LAN bitrate on a relayed link and the encoder collapsed to a soft picture. Tailscale addresses are
private but may be relayed, so they count as cloud.

**A desktop is text.** Degradation preference is `maintainResolution`: an idle screen sends almost
nothing, which starves the bandwidth estimate, and under `balanced` the encoder answers by
shrinking the picture. Measured over the same relay, `balanced` settled at 960x540 and
`maintainResolution` at 1920x1080.

**Absolute pointer moves need a timestamp gate.** They travel on an unordered channel with no
retransmits, so on a relayed link a reordered pair snaps the cursor backwards. The host ignores a
move older than the newest applied. Relative moves need no gate, being additive.

**One offer at a time.** The reconnect loop used to issue a fresh ICE restart every half second; on
a link with a 600 ms round trip a second offer left before the first was answered, and the late
answer killed the session. An offer is outstanding for ten seconds and late answers are ignored.

**A custom header is not a title bar.** The window draws its content under a transparent title
bar, so the app's own header covers it and AppKit never sees those clicks: dragging the window and
double clicking to zoom both stop working. The header's background view now does both itself, and
SwiftUI decides what counts as empty space, because it routes a click down to that view only when
none of the header's own controls wants it. Two approaches that do not work: AppKit hit testing
cannot tell blank header space from a SwiftUI button, since SwiftUI answers with one hosting view
for the whole area; and making the background refuse clicks gives native dragging but puts the
double click out of reach.

**Synthetic clicks need a mouse move first.** A test that posts a click at a point the cursor is
not already at makes the window jump by that distance during a drag, which reads as a broken
gesture. The event also needs its click count set, and the traffic lights are only twelve points
wide, so an aim a pixel out looks like a dead button. Getting this wrong sent several hours after
imaginary bugs.

**Codec names are upper case on the wire.** The phone's first session request was dropped in
silence: the schema lists the codec enum as `H264`, the phone sent `h264`, and a payload that fails
validation is refused without a reply, which looks exactly like a Mac that is asleep. When a
message vanishes, check it against the schema before checking the network.

**A video view told to fill the screen will stretch.** The renderer sizes its surface to the frame
and lets the compositor scale it to the view, so a 16:9 desktop across a 20:9 phone came out
stretched, and the pointer landed a quarter of a screen from the finger. The view has to measure
itself to the frame's shape and let the black bars fall where they will. The mapping was proved by
tapping known points and reading the Mac's real cursor, not by looking.

**Check the phone's frames against the schemas.** `npm run android-frames` validates every data
channel frame the Android app can send, using the same validator the host uses. It caught four
frames the Mac would have dropped in silence: the wrong application name in `hello`, an invented
`prefer` value, and a missing `nonce` and `reason` on `ping` and `bye`.

**Relative pointer moves must accumulate, not re-read the cursor.** Adding each delta to wherever
the system says the cursor is loses most of a fast drag, because the window server has not applied
the previous move yet. Measured from a phone in trackpad mode, between a third and a half of the
distance vanished, and raising the speed made it worse rather than better. The host now adds each
delta to the position it last asked for, and resynchronises only after a pause long enough to mean
the user let go.

**The Dock icon follows the window, and the policy change costs the video.** The app is an
accessory while it lives in the menu bar, and a normal app while a window is open, so a Mac started
at login adds no Dock icon and an open window can take keyboard focus. Changing the activation
policy leaves an existing Metal-backed video view drawing nothing, so every change now posts a
notification and the video view is rebuilt with a fresh id. The close button is redirected to put
the window away rather than close it, because closing destroys the scene's views and SwiftUI's
replacement window comes back black. Quit really quits: the launch agent restarts the app only
after a crash, never after the owner chose Quit.

**State an H.264 level the picture actually fits in.** Android offers level 3.1, whose ceiling is
1280x720. A Mac that cannot meet the level in the offer does not complain: it quietly encodes VP8,
and the only symptoms are a picture costing ten to twenty times the bandwidth and arriving at a
third of the frame rate. Raising the offer to 4.2 fixed a 1080p Mac and still failed on a 1920x1200
one, because that resolution needs more macroblocks than 4.2 allows. The phone now asks its own
decoder what it supports and offers that, capped at 5.2: libwebrtc's parser knows no level above
5.2, and claiming 6.2 makes the Mac discard the H.264 line entirely and the session dies during
negotiation. Measured against a 1920x1200 desktop: VP8 at 3000 kbps became H.264 at 120 kbps, same
resolution, same thirty frames a second.

**Say which codec you want, or you will get VP8.** Neither side stated a preference, so the phone's
offer listed VP8 first, the Mac agreed, and a Mac with a hardware H.264 encoder spent its time
encoding VP8 in software: eight to seventeen frames a second, where H.264 gives full motion. The
phone now puts H.264 first in its offer, and the host names H.264 constrained baseline as its
preferred codec rather than accepting whatever the factory lists first. The phone's session panel is
what found this, which is the argument for showing real numbers instead of a spinner.

**A pairing code is decoded on the phone.** Scanning uses the camera's brightness plane and a
barcode reader compiled into the app: no Play Services, no upload, nothing kept. Typing that code
by hand is the worst part of pairing, and the Mac already draws it as a QR.

**A scanner needs resolution and focus, and CameraX gives neither by default.** The first build
looked alive — preview moving, frames arriving — and never read a code. Analysis frames default to
640x480, which is not enough pixels for a QR holding a public key hash and several addresses, and
nothing ever asked the camera to focus, so the picture stayed soft at the distance a phone is
naturally held from a screen. The fix was all three together: ask for 1920x1080 analysis frames,
trigger a focus on open, on tap, and again after every thirty frames that decoded nothing, and turn
on the reader's `TRY_HARDER` hint. A scanner that does nothing gives no clue which of the three is
missing, so check all three at once.

**Probe every address at once.** A Mac advertises a local address and a tailnet address, and trying
them in turn means waiting out a timeout on the wrong network before the right one is attempted at
all, which reads as a phone that cannot connect from a cafe. Both halves now probe in parallel and
use the first that answers, remembering it for next time. The phone can also pin one by hand, which
is the answer when only Tailscale will reach a Mac.

**Copy the gestures people already know.** The phone's controls follow what Microsoft, Chrome
Remote Desktop, Splashtop and Jump Desktop settled on, including the one that looks odd until it is
explained: a drag with the button held has to be entered deliberately, by tapping twice and holding,
because a plain finger drag has to stay free to point at things. Without that gesture there is no
way to select text or move a window. The logic lives in `Gestures`, away from Android's event
classes, because multi-touch cannot be synthesised over the debugging bridge and this is the only
way to test it at all.

**A stream that keeps sending is not a stream that is working.** ScreenCaptureKit stops on display
sleep, screen lock and display reconfiguration, and never restarts. The agent used to declare
`onStopped` and never assign it, so the failure was logged and dropped; meanwhile the static-screen
repeat timer went on re-sending the last frame for ever. The result was the worst kind of bug:
frames arriving at a healthy rate, bitrate low because identical frames encode to almost nothing,
WebRTC's own freeze counters at zero, input still working — and a frozen picture that never came
back, not even after unlocking. Now `CaptureSupervisor` retries until capture both starts and
delivers a frame, and `capture_state` tells the controller which it is.

**Two signals, never one, when deciding capture is dead.** A motionless desktop produces no
complete frames either, so silence alone would have the agent restarting its own capture every few
seconds on an idle Mac. Liveness is measured from sample buffers of *any* status — an idle stream
still delivers them — and silence only counts when the window server agrees the screen is locked or
the display is asleep. `CaptureRepeatPolicy` holds that rule and is unit tested from both sides.

**Restarting is not recovering.** At the lock screen ScreenCaptureKit opens a stream quite happily
and then produces nothing. Reporting that as recovery puts the frozen picture back with no
explanation, so the supervisor waits for an actual frame before saying `active`.

**A waking display stops capture two or three more times before it settles.** Found by running the
real thing: `pmset displaysleepnow` during a live session, then `caffeinate -u`. Capture came back,
delivered a frame, and ScreenCaptureKit stopped it again within a second with "Failed to find any
displays or windows to capture" while the display list churned — three pause/resume cycles in four
seconds, flickering the controller's banner. Two rules came out of that, and both are load-bearing:
a freshly started capture is given `settleAfterStartMs` before anything may call it dead, and an
outage is not announced to the controller until it has lasted `reportAfterMs`. Restarting through a
blip is right; narrating it is not.

**The phone had been throwing the control channel away.** `WebRTCClient`'s data channel observer
registered an `onMessage` with an empty body, so every message the Mac sent was discarded. That
made `capture_state` invisible, and it also meant a `display_info` sent mid-session never landed:
pointer mapping kept using the size learned at SESSION_ACCEPT, so a host display that changed size
would have put every touch in the wrong place. `DataChannel.parse` now decodes the three messages
the phone acts on and returns null for everything else, because a newer Mac is allowed to send
types this build has never heard of and dropping the session over that would be worse.

**A `lateinit` that nothing assigns is a crash waiting for the gesture that reads it.** `holdMark`,
the circle shown while a drag holds the mouse button down, was declared and never created: three
reads, no assignment, and the compiler is happy because that is what `lateinit` promises. Every
tap-twice-and-hold — the gesture for selecting text and dragging windows — killed the app, and
because `buttonDown` is sent just before the read, it did so with the Mac's left button held. Two
of these sat in the phone's dropbox from 2026-09-10 and nobody had looked. Worth an occasional
`adb shell dumpsys dropbox --print` and a sweep of `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`: the devices
keep a record of every crash, whether or not anyone was watching when it happened.

**Verify this one by watching frames, not the connection.** The proof that the fix works is the
frame rate going to **0** for the length of the outage. Before the fix it stayed at ~30 fps on a
frozen picture, because the repeat timer kept feeding the encoder the same frame — which is exactly
why nothing downstream noticed.

**Measure, do not squint.** Stream statistics (`app stats`) and a pixel-brightness check on
screenshots settled several questions that eyes could not.

## 7. Where it runs today

Both Macs run only `~/Applications/PRC.app` under the `com.prc.app` LaunchAgent, hosting on, with
Screen Recording and Accessibility granted. Identities survived the migration from the split apps,
so nothing needed re-pairing: Mac mini `8C65-1C4E-DC44`, MacBook `D7C4-ABCA-3669`, each holding the
other in both directions.

The phone is a Redmi K80 running the debug build, paired with both Macs, reaching them on the LAN
and over the tailnet.

Measured: LAN 1920x1080 at 52 to 58 fps with 8 to 12 ms round trip. Over Tailscale, when it cannot
connect the two directly, it relays and the round trip becomes several hundred milliseconds at
under a megabit; the picture stays sharp and the frame rate gives way. `tailscale netcheck` shows
why a direct path is unavailable: on this network the home router offers no port mapping.

## 8. Not built

- The rendezvous server and TURN. Deferred in favour of Tailscale; the protocol still describes
  them.
- Audio from host to controller. Possible, but this WebRTC build can only take audio from a real
  input device on macOS, so it means carrying encoded audio on a data channel of our own.
- Clipboard, file transfer, multiple monitors, local cursor rendering.
- Waking a sleeping host. The Mac mini has `womp 1` on AC power, so a magic packet on the LAN would
  work; from outside the LAN it cannot, because a magic packet does not route over a tailnet.
- Cancelling an attempt while it is connecting, on either controller.
- The phone ignores `pong`, so it has no round trip time of its own from the control channel (the
  info panel takes one from `getStats` instead), there is no ping keepalive from it, and it does
  not reconnect by itself when the network changes. It does now read `display_info`,
  `capture_state` and `bye`.
- Retiring the two superseded app targets in `apps/mac-agent` and `apps/mac-controller`.

## 9. Conventions

Ask before committing. Keep `packages/protocol` as the source of truth and regenerate after
changing a schema or the key table. For local smoke runs use `--file-identity`, a temporary
`--data-dir`, and `--synthetic-screen`, so nothing prompts and nothing lands in the real
Application Support folder. For work across both Macs, copy the tree to the other machine and keep
its data outside the copied folder, since a sync with delete would erase it.
