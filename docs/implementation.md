# PRC as built

What exists today, how it works, and the things that were learned the hard way. The design this
follows is [spec.md](spec.md); where the two differ, this file describes reality and the spec has
been amended to match.

Written 2026-09-09, at commit `9e2328b` on branch `v0.2-hybrid`. Tag `v0.1.0` on `main` is the
last state where the agent and the controller were separate apps.

---

## 1. What it does

One Mac shows its screen to another and accepts its mouse and keyboard. It works on a LAN with no
server at all, and across the Internet over a Tailscale tailnet. Every message that sets up a
session is signed by a per-device key, so neither the network nor a relay can impersonate either
side or read anything.

As of v0.2 a single app fills both roles: a Mac can control, be controlled, or both. Android will
be a controller only.

```

`apps/mac-agent` and `apps/mac-controller` still carry their own SwiftUI app targets from v0.1.
Those are superseded by `apps/prc` and are due for removal; their libraries and CLIs stay.

## 3. How a session happens

1. **Discovery.** The host advertises `_fahad-remote._tcp` over Bonjour with its device id in the
   TXT record. Away from the LAN the controller uses a stored address instead, and tries every
   address it knows in parallel, taking the first that answers.
2. **Signalling.** The host serves a WebSocket on port 47500. There is no server in the middle;
   the design keeps room for one but Tailscale has made it unnecessary.
3. **Authentication.** Request, challenge, auth, accept. Both sides sign, both check the other's
   nonce. Only then is SDP exchanged, and because the SDP travels inside a signed envelope the
   DTLS fingerprint is signed too.
4. **Media.** The controller offers, the host answers. Video is H.264 from ScreenCaptureKit
   through VideoToolbox. Three data channels carry input and control.
5. **Input.** The controller maps pointer positions to normalised coordinates, the host turns them
   back into Quartz events.

## 4. The parts, and why they are shaped that way

### packages/protocol

JSON Schema is the source of truth, not the code. `npm run codegen` emits TypeScript types *and*
the Swift key code table, so the table cannot drift between platforms. `npm run vectors` writes
signing inputs, envelopes, pairing proofs and TURN credentials that both the TypeScript and Swift
test suites consume, which is what proves a message signed on one platform verifies on the other.

### Envelopes

Every signalling message is a signed envelope. The signature covers a fixed context label and eight
fields joined by newline, with the payload as base64 of the exact JSON bytes the sender produced,
so no canonical JSON is needed across three languages. Receiver rules run in a fixed order and any
failure is final: size, version, recipient, known sender, signature, clock skew, replay, schema.

`seq` restarts at 1 per session. In the empty session namespace it restarts per *attempt*: one
pairing exchange, or one session request and its answer. Both sides reset after the reply, so a
retry starts again at 1.

### PRCPeers

One record per peer holding the key once and two independent permissions: **may control us** and
**we may control it**. Key lookups are gated on the relevant permission, so revoking a direction
makes verification fail closed rather than relying on a check at the call site. A peer allowed
neither is dropped.

Pairing sets both directions. That costs nothing in trust, because a single pairing already
exchanges both public keys and both people compare fingerprints. What stops a Mac being controlled
is its own hosting switch, which is off until turned on.

### The app

`apps/prc` runs as a menu bar item with a window on demand. Hosting is off by default and turning
it on is what constructs the hosting half, so a Mac used only as a controller never touches screen
capture and is never asked for those permissions.

### Testing without hardware

- `--synthetic-screen` streams a generated pattern, so video paths can be exercised with no Screen
  Recording permission and no display.
- `PRCLocalControl` gives each app a loopback port and a token in its data folder, so a script can
  press the same buttons a person would. This is how pairing, connecting and measuring were driven
  from a second Mac over SSH.
- `tools/e2e` spawns the real agent binary and drives it from Node using werift, a WebRTC
  implementation independent of libwebrtc, which is a genuine interoperability check.

## 5. Building, installing, testing

```sh
npm install
npm test                                   # protocol package
npm run e2e                                # end to end against the real agent binary
(cd packages/swift && swift test)
(cd apps/mac-agent && swift test)
(cd apps/mac-controller && swift test)

scripts/build-apps.sh prc                  # dist/PRC.app, ad-hoc signed
scripts/install-prc.sh                     # ~/Applications, menu bar, starts at login
scripts/install-prc.sh --stage             # copy only, for a Mac you are away from
scripts/install-prc.sh --replace-agent     # also remove the older split agent
```

Suite sizes at the time of writing: protocol 27, packages/swift 29, agent 25, controller 15, end to
end 16 steps.

## 6. Things that cost time, so they should not cost it twice

**Never change the app's activation policy at runtime.** Switching between accessory and regular
leaves an existing Metal-backed video view drawing nothing: frames still decode and the renderer
still reports their size, so everything looks healthy while the picture is black. The policy is set
once at launch.

**Never close the window to hide it.** Closing destroys the scene's views and the replacement
window gets a dead video view, with the same symptom. Order it out and back in instead.

**Ad-hoc signatures change every build.** macOS ties Screen Recording and Accessibility to the
signature, so after reinstalling, the switch in System Settings can read as on while the new build
has nothing. The install script clears the stale entry with `tccutil reset`. A free local signing
identity would end this, but the owner chose no certificates.

**Declare the real network path.** The controller used to claim `lan` always, so the host seeded a
LAN bitrate on a relayed link and the encoder collapsed to a soft picture. Tailscale addresses are
private but may be relayed, so they count as cloud.

**A desktop is text.** Degradation preference is `maintainResolution`: an idle screen sends almost
nothing, which starves the bandwidth estimate, and under `balanced` the encoder answers by
shrinking the picture. Measured over the same relay, `balanced` settled at 960x540 and
`maintainResolution` at 1920x1080.

**Absolute pointer moves need a timestamp gate.** They travel on an unordered channel with no
retransmits, so on a relayed link a reordered pair snaps the cursor backwards. The host ignores a
move older than the newest applied. Relative moves need no gate, being additive.

**One offer at a time.** The reconnect loop used to issue a fresh ICE restart every half second; on
a link with a 600 ms round trip a second offer left before the first was answered, and the late
answer killed the session. An offer is outstanding for ten seconds and late answers are ignored.

**A custom header is not a title bar.** The window draws its content under a transparent title
bar, so the app's own header covers it and AppKit never sees those clicks: dragging the window and
double clicking to zoom both stop working. The header's background view now does both itself, and
SwiftUI decides what counts as empty space, because it routes a click down to that view only when
none of the header's own controls wants it. Two approaches that do not work: AppKit hit testing
cannot tell blank header space from a SwiftUI button, since SwiftUI answers with one hosting view
for the whole area; and making the background refuse clicks gives native dragging but puts the
double click out of reach.

**Synthetic clicks need a mouse move first.** A test that posts a click at a point the cursor is
not already at makes the window jump by that distance during a drag, which reads as a broken
gesture. The event also needs its click count set, and the traffic lights are only twelve points
wide, so an aim a pixel out looks like a dead button. Getting this wrong sent several hours after
imaginary bugs.

**Measure, do not squint.** Stream statistics (`app stats`) and a pixel-brightness check on
screenshots settled several questions that eyes could not.

## 7. Where it runs today

Both Macs run only `~/Applications/PRC.app` under the `com.prc.app` LaunchAgent, hosting on, with
Screen Recording and Accessibility granted. Identities survived the migration from the split apps,
so nothing needed re-pairing: Mac mini `8C65-1C4E-DC44`, MacBook `D7C4-ABCA-3669`, each holding the
other in both directions.

Measured: LAN 1920x1080 at 52 to 58 fps with 8 to 12 ms round trip. Over Tailscale, when it cannot
connect the two directly, it relays and the round trip becomes several hundred milliseconds at
under a megabit; the picture stays sharp and the frame rate gives way. `tailscale netcheck` shows
why a direct path is unavailable: on this network the home router offers no port mapping.

## 8. Not built

- The rendezvous server and TURN. Deferred in favour of Tailscale; the protocol still describes
  them.
- The Android controller.
- Audio from host to controller. Possible, but this WebRTC build can only take audio from a real
  input device on macOS, so it means carrying encoded audio on a data channel of our own.
- Clipboard, file transfer, multiple monitors, local cursor rendering.
- Retiring the two superseded app targets in `apps/mac-agent` and `apps/mac-controller`.

## 9. Conventions

Ask before committing. Keep `packages/protocol` as the source of truth and regenerate after
changing a schema or the key table. For local smoke runs use `--file-identity`, a temporary
`--data-dir`, and `--synthetic-screen`, so nothing prompts and nothing lands in the real
Application Support folder. For work across both Macs, copy the tree to the other machine and keep
its data outside the copied folder, since a sync with delete would erase it.
